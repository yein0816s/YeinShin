# YeinShin

Hello everyone,

My name is Yein Shin, and I am thrilled to introduce myself to you. Originally hailing from South Korea, I'm currently immersed in the dynamic environment of Columbia University in New York City, pursuing my second master's degree.

Having completed my undergraduate and first master's degrees in business, I decided to delve deeper into the realm of quantitative methods in the social sciences (QMSS) here at Columbia. This shift in focus reflects my keen interest in understanding the intersection of data analysis and social phenomena, a passion that continues to drive my academic pursuits.

Looking ahead, my ultimate aspiration is to become an academic researcher, with the hope of one day securing a faculty position at a leading business school. It is with this goal in mind that I have chosen to further my studies at the University of Michigan - Ross School of Business for my Ph.D. in Strategy upon graduation (starting from 2024-Fall).

One particular area of interest that has captivated my attention is firm boundary choices. I am fascinated by the intricate decision-making processes involved in how firms demarcate their boundaries and, perhaps more importantly, how they implement these decisions. Exploring this topic allows me to combine my background in business with my passion for rigorous research and analysis.

In summary, I am a dedicated and enthusiastic individual who is committed to advancing knowledge in the field of business strategy through academic inquiry. I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to contributing to the scholarly community in meaningful ways.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I am eager to connect with fellow scholars and researchers who share my interests and aspirations.
